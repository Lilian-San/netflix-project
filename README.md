# Exploring Netflix Titles: Trends and Insights

This project analyzes the public **Netflix Titles** dataset to uncover trends in title types, genres, release years, and production countries.

## üìù One-sentence takeaway
Titles rise fast from 2016 and peak in 2018; the later dip mostly reflects a ~1.0-year add-to-Netflix lag and the 2020 slowdown.

## üîé Key Insights
- Movies make up **70%** of titles (Movies: 6,131, TV Shows: 2,676).
- Top producing countries: **United States (3,689), India (1,046), United Kingdom (804)**.
- Top genres: **International Movies, Dramas, Comedies**.
- From 2016‚Üí2018 titles grew **27%** (from 902 to 1,147).
